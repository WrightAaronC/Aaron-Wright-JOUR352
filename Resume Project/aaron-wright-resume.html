        <p class="bodytext">A 2024 graduate from the University of Maryland, College Park, Aaron Carter Wright earned a degree in journalism and a certificate
          in African American and Africana Studies. As you scroll through his resume, you'll see a multimedia-skilled journalist and a capable leader,
          which has its roots from being an Eagle Scout. Outside of journalism, Aaron is an avid Blerd/geek (Black nerd, for the uninitiated), having a wide range
          of interests and knowledge in anime, astronomy, comics, manga, model-kit building (Legos and Gundam), movies, television and video games. He's also a lifelong
          reader, a fan of trivia, a staunch media critic and advocate for civil and human rights: domestic or international. 
          If you see me, ask me about African Diasporic Martial Arts!
