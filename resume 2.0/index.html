    The Black Explosion

    The Black Explosion is the University of Maryland’s first and only Black newspaper since 1968. Sponsored by the Nyumburu Cultural 
    Center, the Black Explosion has served to be a voice for the Black community in the University of Maryland by covering the stories 
    that matter to the community. As a staff writer for the Black Explosion, I reported on various campus events and conducted interviews 
    with students to create stories for Black UMD, delivered story pitches to editors for further consideration and photographed pictures 
    for stories to use as graphics. In August 2023, I became the Co-Editor-in-Chief for the Black Explosion Newspaper. As the Co-EIC, 
    I lead pitch and staff meetings, edited stories and managed the flow of stories from reporter to engagement to publishing.
